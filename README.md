# Gait Cycle Based Apporach for FoG Prediction

{abstract}
Freezing of Gait (FoG) is a common and debilitating symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) that significantly increases the risk of falls. Most existing deep learning approaches for FoG prediction rely on fixed-length sliding-window segmentation of wearable sensor data. Although this strategy generates a large number of training samples and facilitates stable optimization, it often captures only partial gait cycles, leading to incomplete representations of stance–swing dynamics and sub-optimal learning efficiency and prediction performance. In this work, we propose a novel a physiologically informed, gait-cycle based approach that identifies the onset of gait-cycle and ensures sufficient samples to contain a complete gait cycle. Intuitively, this yields a cleaner, more compact, and physiologically meaningful training set that better preserves gait dynamics across cycles. Compared with conventional sliding-window segmentation, the proposed approach achieves improved prediction performance while significantly reducing computational cost. 

{Method}
A gait cycle is typically defined as the interval between two successive heel strikes of the same foot and consists of distinct stance and swing phases, such as stance and heel-off \cite{PappasGaitPhase}. These phases exhibit temporal characteristic and biomechanical patterns that are critical for accurately modeling locomotion dynamics and detecting gait abnormalities associated with FoG. When fixed-length sliding-window segmentation is applied, each window often only captures partial portions of the full gait cycle. Hence, multiple windows are often needed to collectively represent a complete stance-swing sequence. This fragmentation can complicate temporal learning, and thus limit the model performance. %, as phase transitions may be inconsistently distributed across multiple windows.%, increasing the burden on the model to infer long-range dependencies.

To address this limitation, the proposed method will identify the onset of each gait cycle, and ensure sufficient samples to represent a complete gait cycle within each segments. The resulting segments provide more consistent and physiologically interpretable representations of locomotion dynamics, preserving the intrinsic temporal structure of human gait. Intuitively, this alignment facilitates the monitoring of phase-to-phase trends across consecutive gait cycles and potentially provides a more suitable input for learning-based FoG prediction models. In addition, unlike sliding-window approach which spread the important characteristics across multiple segments, this could potentially improve the training efficiency.

First, the IMU signals were low-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 2.5 Hz to suppress high-frequency noise. The onset of a gait cycle was then identified as the positive zero-crossing of the vertical gyroscope ($\mathrm{Gyro}_z$) readings, preceded by a local minimum that falls below a predefined threshold. Using these detected events as onset points ensured that each segment begins at a consistent gait phase as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:gs complete gait}.
